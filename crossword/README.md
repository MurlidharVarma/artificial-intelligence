## Background
How might you go about generating a crossword puzzle? Given the structure of a crossword puzzle (i.e., which squares of the grid are meant to be filled in with a letter), and a list of words to use, the problem becomes one of choosing which words should go in each vertical or horizontal sequence of squares. We can model this sort of problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Each sequence of squares is one variable, for which we need to decide on its value (which word in the domain of possible words will fill in that sequence). Consider the following crossword puzzle structure.

![Crossword Structure](images/structure.png)

In this structure, we have four variables, representing the four words we need to fill into this crossword puzzle (each indicated by a number in the above image). Each variable is defined by four values: the row it begins on (its `i` value), the column it begins on (its `j` value), the direction of the word (either `down` or `across`), and the length of the word. `Variable 1`, for example, would be a variable represented by a row of 1 (assuming 0 indexed counting from the top), a column of 1 (also assuming 0 indexed counting from the left), a direction of `across`, and a length of `4`.

As with many constraint satisfaction problems, these variables have both unary and binary constraints. The unary constraint on a variable is given by its length. For `Variable 1`, for instance, the value `BYTE` would satisfy the unary constraint, but the value `BIT` would not (it has the wrong number of letters). Any values that don’t satisfy a variable’s unary constraints can therefore be removed from the variable’s domain immediately.

The binary constraints on a variable are given by its overlap with neighboring variables. `Variable 1` has a single neighbor: `Variable 2`. `Variable 2` has two neighbors: `Variable 1` and `Variable 3`. For each pair of neighboring variables, those variables share an overlap: a single square that is common to them both. We can represent that overlap as the character index in each variable’s word that must be the same character. For example, the overlap between `Variable 1` and `Variable 2` might be represented as the pair `(1, 0)`, meaning that `Variable 1’s` character at index 1 necessarily must be the same as `Variable 2’s` character at index `0` (assuming 0-indexing, again). The overlap between `Variable 2` and `Variable 3` would therefore be represented as the pair `(3, 1)`: character `3` of `Variable 2’s` value must be the same as character `1` of `Variable 3’s` value.

For this problem, we have added the additional constraint that all words must be different: the same word should not be repeated multiple times in the puzzle.

The program finds a satisfying assignment: a different word (from a given vocabulary list) for each variable such that all of the unary and binary constraints are met.

## Understanding
There are two Python files in this project: `crossword.py` and `generate.py`.

First, `crossword.py` file defines two classes, `Variable` (to represent a variable in a crossword puzzle) and `Crossword` (to represent the puzzle itself).

A `Variable` specifies four values: its row `i`, its column `j`, its direction (either the constant `Variable.ACROSS` or the constant `Variable.DOWN`), and its `length`.

The `Crossword` class requires two values to create a new crossword puzzle: a structure_file that defines the structure of the puzzle (the _ is used to represent blank cells, any other character represents cells that won’t be filled in) and a words_file that defines a list of words (one on each line) to use for the vocabulary of the puzzle. Three examples of each of these files can be found in the data directory of the project.

For any crossword object crossword, we store the following values:

`crossword.height` is an integer representing the height of the crossword puzzle.
`crossword.width` is an integer representing the width of the crossword puzzle.
`crossword.structure` is a 2D list representing the structure of the puzzle. For any valid row `i` and column `j`, `crossword.structure[i][j]` will be `True` if the cell is blank (a character must be filled there) and will be `False` otherwise (no character is to be filled in that cell).
`crossword.words` is a set of all of the words to draw from when constructing the crossword puzzle.
`crossword.variables` is a set of all of the variables in the puzzle (each is a Variable object).
`crossword.overlaps` is a dictionary mapping a pair of variables to their overlap. For any two distinct variables `v1` and `v2`, `crossword.overlaps[v1, v2]` will be None if the two variables have no overlap, and will be a pair of integers `(i, j)` if the variables do overlap. The pair `(i, j)` should be interpreted to mean that the ith character of v1’s value must be the same as the jth character of v2’s value.
Crossword objects support a method `neighbors` that returns all of the variables that overlap with a given variable. That is to say, `crossword.neighbors(v1)` will return a set of all of the variables that are neighbors to the variable v1.

Next, `generate.py` defines a class `CrosswordCreator` that is used to solve the crossword puzzle. When a `CrosswordCreator` object is created, it gets a crossword property that should be a `Crossword` object (and therefore has all of the properties described above). Each `CrosswordCreator` object also gets a domains property: a dictionary that maps variables to a set of possible words the variable might take on as a value. Initially, this set of words is all of the words in our vocabulary.

Function `print` will print to the terminal a representation of your crossword puzzle for a given assignment (every assignment, in this function and elsewhere, is a dictionary mapping variables to their corresponding words). `save`, meanwhile, generates an image file corresponding to a given assignment (you’ll need to pip3 install Pillow). `letter_grid` is a helper function used by both print and save that generates a 2D list of all characters in their appropriate positions for a given assignment.

Finally, notice the solve function. This function does three things: first, it calls `enforce_node_consistency` to enforce node consistency on the crossword puzzle, ensuring that every value in a variable’s domain satisfy the unary constraints. Next, the function calls ac3 to enforce arc consistency, ensuring that binary constraints are satisfied. Finally, the function calls backtrack on an initially empty assignment (the empty dictionary dict()) to try to calculate a solution to the problem.

The `enforce_node_consistency` function updates self.domains such that each variable is node consistent.

The `revise` function makes the variable x arc consistent with the variable y.

The `ac3` function implements the AC3 algorithm, to enforce arc consistency on the problem. Arc consistency is achieved when all the values in each variable’s domain satisfy that variable’s binary constraints.

The `assignment_complete` function checks to see if a given assignment is complete.

The `consistent` function checks to see if a given assignment is consistent.

The `order_domain_values` function returns a list of all of the values in the domain of variables, ordered according to the least-constraining values heuristic.

The `select_unassigned_variable` function returns a single variable in the crossword puzzle that is not yet assigned by assignment, according to the minimum remaining value heuristic and then the degree heuristic.

The `backtrack` function accepts a partial assignment assignment as input and, using backtracking search, return a complete satisfactory assignment of variables to values if it is possible to do so.
